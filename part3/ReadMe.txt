Two men in black suits and sunglasses were seen visiting a famous
radio-astronomer, who recently published some work on a weird and
very noisy signal coming from the area of the red dwarf Gliese 388.
The activist hacker group "BGU" obtained and published a copy of her recent research
notes, which contained 2 recorded messages.
The first was already preprocessed and decoded. It was "Bang, zoom,
straight to the moon!".
The second message was only preprocessed, but not yet decoded.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to decode the
second message.
Good Luck!

Hint: think of ascii possibilities in binary representation, and compare characters that appear more than once.
